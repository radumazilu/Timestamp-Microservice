<h2>User Stories</h2>
<ul>
<li>I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016)</li>
<li>If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.</li>
<li>If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.</li>
</ul>
